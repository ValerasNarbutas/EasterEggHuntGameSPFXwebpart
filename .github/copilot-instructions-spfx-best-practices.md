# 📘 SPFx + React Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for building robust, maintainable, and high-performing SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions using React.

---

## 🧱 General SPFx Best Practices

### ✅ Use the Latest Supported SPFx Version
- Always scaffold solutions using the latest supported SPFx version for your tenant.
- Check compatibility with Microsoft 365: SPFx Release Compatibility

### 📁 Organize Your Project Structure
- Use a **feature-based** folder structure:

    src/
      components/
        FeatureA/
        FeatureB/
      services/
      models/
      utils/

- Group components, styles, services, and tests logically.

### 🧩 Use Environment-Aware Logic
- Leverage Environment.type for handling local vs. hosted vs. Teams/Outlook/Office environments.

### 🔒 Avoid Hardcoded Strings & IDs
- Use constants or localization with @microsoft/sp-core-library and .loc.json files.
- Store IDs and URLs in configuration or property pane settings.

### 📦 Use PnPjs and Reusable Services
- Encapsulate SharePoint calls using PnPjs.
- Centralize API calls in a /services folder.

## ⚛️ React-Specific Best Practices

### 🪝 Prefer Functional Components with Hooks
- Use useState, useEffect, and other React hooks over class-based components.
- Example:

    const MyComponent = () => {
      const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
      useEffect(() => {
        // fetch data
      }, []);
      return <div>{items.length} items</div>;
    };

### 🎨 CSS and Styling
- Use scss modules (e.g., MyComponent.module.scss) for scoped styles.
- Use classnames library to conditionally apply styles.

### 🧪 Unit Test Components
- Use Jest with React Testing Library or Enzyme.
- Mock SPFx-specific services like spHttpClient or msGraphClient.

### 🗃️ Use Web Part Properties Wisely
- Keep the property pane clean and simple.
- Avoid overly complex logic in the property pane; move business logic into React components.

### 🔄 Handle State and Props Carefully
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders with React.memo or useMemo when needed.
- Keep components as stateless as possible; lift state when necessary.

## 🧰 Tooling & Development Tips

### 🔄 Enable Live Reload
- Use gulp serve --nobrowser and manually load the web part using a local workbench or hosted workbench.

### 🚦Use Linting and Formatting
- Integrate ESLint and Prettier for consistent code quality and formatting.

### 📸 Use Placeholder Content for Better UX
- Show spinners/loaders or friendly empty states while data loads.

### 📁 Avoid Large Bundles
- Dynamically import rarely used components or large libraries.

    const LazyComp = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));

## 📈 Performance Tips

- Avoid rendering large lists directly; use pagination or virtualization.
- Minimize the number of re-renders by optimizing props and state updates.
- Use SPFx preloading techniques for faster loads.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- Sanitize input/output to avoid XSS attacks (especially with dangerouslySetInnerHTML).
- Validate and encode external URLs or embedded content.
