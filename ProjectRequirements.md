| Requirement ID | Description                     | User Story                                                                                           | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                              |
|----------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Starting the Game               | As a user, I want to be able to start a new Easter Egg Hunt session so I can begin playing.           | The system should display a **Start Game** button that initializes the timer and places clickable eggs randomly.        |
| FR002          | Clicking on Eggs                | As a user, I want to be able to click on eggs to collect them and increase my score.                  | When an egg is clicked, it should animate (e.g., bounce/pop), disappear, and increase the player's score.               |
| FR003          | Scoring System                  | As a user, I want to see my current score while playing the game.                                     | The system should display a live score counter during the game session.                                                  |
| FR004          | Countdown Timer                 | As a user, I want to know how much time I have left to find eggs.                                     | A visible countdown timer should start when the game begins and stop when the time runs out.                            |
| FR005          | Game Over State                 | As a user, I want to see a summary of my performance after the game ends.                             | When the timer reaches zero, the system should show the total score and display a “Play Again” button.                  |
| FR006          | Random Egg Placement            | As a user, I want the eggs to appear in random locations to make the game fun and unpredictable.       | The system should randomly place eggs in non-overlapping positions within the game area at the start of each session.    |
| FR007          | Bonus Eggs                      | As a user, I want to occasionally find golden or special eggs with extra points or surprises.          | Randomly generated bonus eggs should be worth more points and may display fun messages when clicked.                    |
| FR008          | Persistent Leaderboard (Optional) | As an administrator, I want to track high scores of players so that the top performers are recognized. | The system should save scores to a SharePoint list with player name and date, and display a leaderboard component.       |
| FR009          | Responsive Design               | As a user, I want the game to work on different screen sizes including mobile.                         | The SPFx web part should be responsive and work seamlessly across modern browsers and screen sizes.                      |
| FR010          | Easter Theme & Animations       | As a user, I want the game to feel festive and fun with appropriate visuals.                          | The interface should include themed images (eggs, bunny, basket) and animations to enhance the experience.               |
| FR011          | Custom Game Settings (Optional) | As an admin or user, I want to configure game duration and number of eggs.                            | Provide a settings panel in the web part properties to adjust time limit and number of eggs per session.                 |
| FR012          | Accessibility Considerations    | As a user with different abilities, I want the game to be accessible.                                | The game should support keyboard navigation, screen readers, and have accessible color contrast for egg visuals.         |
